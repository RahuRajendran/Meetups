# Meetups
A simple react app to create and display Meetups. Implemented to understand the basics of Reactjs. The main focus of the app is to understand the important and core concepts of react and how they can be used to build single page applications. 
# Steps followed to build the project
I have used visual studio code as my editor  
Installed node on my system.  
Used npx create-react-app to intilise and create the project structure with react.  
Then use npx start to start the react project on the local machine.  
Please run npm install to install and load all the dependencies if intrested in running from your local computer. Run npm start after that.  
# Dependencies
The Meetups are stored and reterived from a firebase database.  
We make HTTP get and post request to display all the meetups and create new meetups.  
# Source Files
The src folder contains the source code. Here you can find three seprate folders.  
components folder: Contains custom components to create and display meetups. It also contains the components for navigating with in the app.  
pages folder: Contains differnt pages that are seen by the users of the application. Each page is a component in itself which uses the components from the components folder which allows users to view create meetups for the users.  
store folder: Contains the logic to manage and update the state through out the application. React context is used to achive this.

You will also be asked whether or not Firebase should configure as a single-page app. Youâ€™ll want to enter y (Yes) for this option.
